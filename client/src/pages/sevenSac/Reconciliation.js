    <h1>RECONCILIATION – Hearts turning back to God</h1>
   
    <p>In the sacrament of Reconciliation (also known as confession and absolution), the Christian confesses their sins to God in the presence of a Priest who acts as a witness only. Confession recognizes sin as the source of alienation from God, and it restores the believer to His love and forgiveness. The Orthodox Church does not practice “anonymous” confession as done in the Roman Catholic Church. Instead, the priest stands with the person, usually facing the altar together.</p>
