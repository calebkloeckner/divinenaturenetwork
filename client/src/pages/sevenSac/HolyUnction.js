    <h1>ANOINTING OF THE SICK – Divine healing of body, mind, & spirit</h1>
   
    <p>Sometimes this sacrament is known as “Holy Unction.” When a person suffers from illness and pain, they are anointed with oil by the Priest. As with Chrismation, oil is also used in this Sacrament as a sign of God’s presence, strength, and forgiveness. It is the recognition that Christ is with us through the ministry of His Church. We believe that this is the same Christ who healed the lepers and raised the dead. The mysterion of the Anointing of the Sick is not an empty symbol, it is the faithful submission of our lives into the hands of the great physician, our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
