    <h1>HOLY MATRIMONY – Two become one in Christ</h1>
   
    <p>The joining of two souls in marriage is also considered to be a Holy mystery in the Orthodox Church. Marriage is a public celebration of the union of husband and wife. Spiritually, they become “one flesh,” and by the Holy Spirit the couple is called to live out their eternal vocation together on this earth. They are to nurture and encourage each other in the spiritual life. Together, the husband and wife draw closer to God through the mutual submission of love.</p>
