    <h1>CHRISMATION – Recieving the Holy Spirit</h1>

    <p>The sacrament of Chrismation is essentially the impartation of the Holy Spirit upon the baptized believer. Chrismation immediately follows Baptism in the Orthodox church. It is a beautiful liturgical act in which the celebrant anoints the body of the baptized believer using the words, “(the person’s name), is sealed with the seal of the Holy Spirit.”</p>
